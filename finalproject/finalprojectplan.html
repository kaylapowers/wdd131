	<h1>Vanguard Prep Academy Website Plan</h1>
	<h2>Project Description</h2>
	<p>
		Final Project: Vanguard Prep Academy website. The name was selected to match the name of the business entity.
	</p>

	<p> Reason: I have been taking these courses at BYU Idaho specifically so I could design and implement a website for
		a
		non-profit
		organization, which I run, and specifically for the Vanguard Prep Academy, which I hope to start at some point
	</p>



	<h2>Purpose of Site</h2>

	<ul>
		<li> This is a full-time preparatory academy that develops young leaders who want to focus on learning in an
			environment
			where prayer and worship are not only encouraged but scheduled into the learning day.
			Recruit staff, volunteers, and parents who will enroll their children in our school.
			Allow students to get excited about our program, and voluntarily commit to our more rigorous standards.</li>
		<li>
			Define important terms within our program (Military-Style, Age-Appropriate, STEM-centric,
			College-Preparatory,
			PACES,
			ACE, CAP, Scouts, Cadet, Junior-Cadet, Cubicle, )</li>

		<li> Sign up for information, enrollment, or to ask questions.</li>
	</ul>


	<h2>Target Market</h2>

	<p>
		Service-minded adults and students with Christian values who believe in youth development, have a strong
		love
		for the
		Savior, and integrate his teachings into daily life. They are committed to standing up for what is right,
		fostering
		lifelong learning, and striving for exceptional achievement.
	</p>

	<h2>Scenarios</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>A parent wants to know if their student, who has been suspended from another school, can come to the
			Military Style
			School to be disciplined. </li>
		<li>A high school student is looking for a challenging environment that is rich in experiential learning and
			wants to learn
			to become a better leader. </li>
		<li> A junior high student wants to make up some subjects that they consider themselves harder to learn.
			They would like to
			get to grade level work.</li>
		<li>An adult would like to join as a volunteer for the classroom, or activity of the partner organizations.
		</li>
		<li>A student would like to earn certificates and credits that could be applied towards careers of which are
			self-disciplined in nature such as pilot, EMS, Medical, Search and Rescue, emergency preparedness, etc.
